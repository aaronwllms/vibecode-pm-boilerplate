# Documentation

This directory contains all project documentation organized into categories.

## Getting Started Guides

- **[Quick Start for PMs](./QUICK_START_FOR_PMS.md)** - Complete guide for Product Managers working with AI development tools 🚀

## Directory Structure

- **`archive/`** - Archived/completed content with prefixed filenames
- **`api/`** - API documentation, OpenAPI specs, and context docs
- **`features/`** - Feature architecture docs with visual diagrams (Mermaid)
- **`prd/`** - Product requirements documents
- **`todo/`** - Active todo items

## Guidelines

- Use kebab-case for filenames
- When archiving, prefix with original directory: `<dir>-<filename>.md`
- Never delete completed items - always archive them
- Keep directory structure flat (no subdirectories)
