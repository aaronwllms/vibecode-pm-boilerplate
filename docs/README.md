# Documentation

This directory contains all project documentation organized into 5 categories.

## Directory Structure

- **`archive/`** - Archived/completed content with prefixed filenames
- **`api/`** - API documentation, OpenAPI specs, and context docs
- **`guides/`** - All guides, standards, troubleshooting, and architecture docs
- **`prd/`** - Product requirements documents
- **`todo/`** - Active todo items

## Guidelines

- Use kebab-case for filenames
- When archiving, prefix with original directory: `<dir>-<filename>.md`
- Never delete completed items - always archive them
- Keep directory structure flat (no subdirectories)

For complete documentation standards, see `.cursor/rules/documentation.mdc`
