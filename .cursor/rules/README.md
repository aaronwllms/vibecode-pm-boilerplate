# Cursor Rules for SupaNext Starter

This directory contains modular Cursor AI rules using the new `.mdc` format, consolidated from battle-tested patterns on [cursorrules.org](https://cursorrules.org) and optimized for this specific codebase.

## Sources
These rules are derived from:
- [TypeScript (Next.js, Supabase)](https://cursorrules.org/article/typescript-nextjs-supabase-cursorrules-prompt-file)
- [Next.js, Supabase, Shadcn PWA](https://cursorrules.org/article/nextjs-supabase-shadcn-pwa-cursorrules-prompt-file) (PWA parts excluded)
- [Next.js (React, Tailwind)](https://cursorrules.org/article/nextjs-react-tailwind-cursorrules-prompt-file)
- [Git Conventional Commits](https://cursorrules.org/article/git-conventional-commit-messages)
- [DRY & SOLID Principles](https://cursorrules.org/article/optimize-dry-solid-principles-cursorrules-prompt-f)
- Project-specific patterns from this codebase

## What We Adopted
✅ **From Community Rules:**
- DRY and SOLID principles
- 150-line file size limit
- RORO pattern (Receive Object, Return Object)
- Arrow functions for components
- Named exports preference
- Conventional commits specification (complete spec)
- Specific Web Vitals optimization guidance
- Mobile-first responsive design patterns
- Minimize 'use client' usage patterns

✅ **Project-Specific Additions:**
- Supabase @supabase/ssr integration patterns
- TanStack Query v5 specific guidance
- Jest + React Testing Library + MSW v2 patterns
- Existing file structure and import conventions
- pnpm package manager usage

## What We Excluded
❌ **Not Relevant to This Project:**
- PWA functionality (Progressive Web App features)
- Vercel AI SDK integration
- Build Notes system (project management approach)
- Monorepo structure and conventions
- Zustand state management (using TanStack Query instead)
- Taskfile.yml commands (using pnpm scripts)
- nuqs for URL state (not currently in use)

This directory contains modular Cursor AI rules using the new `.mdc` format. Each file targets specific aspects of the codebase with file pattern matching.

## Rule Files

**Note:** As of the latest optimization, UI rules have been split into three focused files for better maintainability and clearer separation of concerns.

## How It Works

Cursor AI automatically reads these rules and applies them based on:
1. **File patterns** defined in the `globs` frontmatter
2. **Context** of what you're working on
3. **Consolidation** from multiple matching rules

## Updating Rules

To modify a rule:
1. Edit the relevant `.mdc` file
2. Changes take effect immediately in Cursor
3. Commit changes so your team stays in sync

## Benefits of This Structure

✅ **Modular** - Easy to update individual concerns  
✅ **Context-aware** - Rules apply to relevant files only  
✅ **Focused** - UI rules split into 3 files (shadcn, styling, accessibility) for clarity  
✅ **Optimized size** - All files under 200 lines (recommended < 500 lines)  
✅ **Version controlled** - Rules live with your code  
✅ **Team consistency** - Everyone gets the same AI assistance  
✅ **Maintainable** - Clear separation of concerns

## File Size Optimization
- **Previous**: 1 large ui-styling.mdc file (344 lines)
- **Now**: 3 focused files (~150, ~150, ~200 lines respectively)
- **Benefit**: Easier to scan, update, and maintain specific concerns
