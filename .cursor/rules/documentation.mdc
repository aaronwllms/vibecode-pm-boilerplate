# Docs Directory Management Standards

## Purpose

Simplified 4-directory structure prevents docs sprawl and makes archiving predictable. Prefixed archive naming preserves context without nested directories, enabling easy search and reference while maintaining origin traceability.

## Directory Structure

- `archive/` - All archived/completed content (flat structure with prefixes)
- `api/` - API documentation (OpenAPI specs, context docs)
- `features/` - Feature architecture docs with visual diagrams (Mermaid)
- `prd/` - Product requirements documents
- `todo/` - Active todo items (no subdirectories)

**Do NOT create new top-level directories** - use existing categories.

## Archive Naming Pattern

When archiving, prefix filename with original directory: `<original-dir>-<filename>.md`

**Examples:**
- `todo/feature-request.md` → `archive/todo-feature-request.md`
- `features/dual-cache.md` → `archive/features-dual-cache.md`

This keeps archives flat while preserving origin context.

## When to Archive

Archive when:
- Migration guides are complete
- Troubleshooting docs are resolved
- Todo items are completed
- Legacy content is no longer referenced

**Do NOT archive:**
- Active guides/standards
- Current API docs or PRDs
- Ongoing todo items

**Never delete** - always archive to preserve history.

## Workflow Checklist

When archiving:
- [ ] Identify original directory
- [ ] Rename: `<original-dir>-<filename>.md`
- [ ] Move to `docs/archive/`
- [ ] Update cross-references if needed

## Active File Conventions

- Use kebab-case filenames
- No prefixes for active files
- Be descriptive but concise
- Place in appropriate top-level directory

## Maintenance

Periodically review:
- `todo/` for completed items to archive
- `features/` for outdated content
- `archive/` consolidation opportunities
