# Git Workflow & Conventional Commits

## Conventional Commit Format
Use structured commit messages for clear history:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Commit Types (Following Conventional Commits Specification)
- **feat**: New feature (MUST be used when adding new functionality)
- **fix**: Bug fix (MUST be used for bug fixes)
- **docs**: Documentation changes only
- **test**: Test additions or changes
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without functionality changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, whitespace, etc.)
- **chore**: Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **ci**: CI/CD configuration changes
- **build**: Changes affecting build system or dependencies

## Breaking Changes
- Breaking changes MUST be indicated with `!` before the colon: `feat!: change API signature`
- OR include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit footer
- Example with footer:
  ```
  feat: update authentication flow
  
  BREAKING CHANGE: authentication now requires email verification
  ```

## Examples
```bash
feat: add user profile avatar upload component

fix: resolve authentication redirect loop on login page

test: add integration tests for message API endpoint

refactor: extract email validation into reusable utility

docs: update README with new environment variables

perf: optimize image loading with next/image priority
```

## Scope (Optional)
Add scope for better context:
```bash
feat(auth): add password reset functionality
fix(api): handle null response in message endpoint
test(components): add tests for AuthButton component
```

## Commit Message Structure
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Commit Best Practices
- Commits MUST be prefixed with a type followed by optional scope, optional `!`, and REQUIRED colon and space
- Keep commits atomic and focused on one change
- Write clear commit messages explaining the "why"
- Subject MUST immediately follow the colon and space
- Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Body and footer are optional but provide context when needed
- Reference issue numbers when applicable: `fix: resolve login bug (#123)`
- Scope MAY be provided after type: `feat(auth): add password reset`

## Pre-commit Hooks
Husky automatically runs on pre-commit:
- Prettier formatting
- ESLint checks
- Type checking
- Tests (in CI)

## Before Committing
Run quality checks:
```bash
pnpm type-check  # TypeScript check
pnpm lint        # ESLint check
pnpm format      # Auto-format with Prettier
pnpm test        # Run tests
```

## Branch Naming
Use descriptive branch names:
```bash
feature/user-authentication
fix/login-redirect-bug
refactor/api-error-handling
test/add-component-tests
```
