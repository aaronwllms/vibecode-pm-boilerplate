# General Conventions

## Date & Time Awareness
- **Always check the current date** from the system information provided at conversation start
- Never assume or guess dates for timestamps, migrations, or versioning
- When creating date-dependent artifacts (migrations, logs, changelogs), explicitly confirm the date
- Use ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) for dates in filenames and code
- Migration files should use format: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`

## Environment Awareness
- Check the OS, shell, and workspace path from system information
- Verify workspace context before making assumptions about project structure
- Respect the current shell environment when proposing terminal commands

## Timestamp Conventions
- Database migrations: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` format
- Log files: Include ISO timestamp
- Version tags: Follow semantic versioning (semver)
- Git commits: Let Git handle timestamps automatically
